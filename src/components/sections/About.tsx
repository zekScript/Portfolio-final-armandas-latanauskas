                        <p>I like looking at errors and take time solve problems with trial and error. Also love building websites with alot of functionality. My dream life is having fully remote job and camping around with Transit/Sprinter vans. Learning new coding languages and adapting to new tech it's a plus to me, always motivated to work hard.</p>
